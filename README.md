<h3> Hey there, my name is Nikita, better known as Intervinn </h3>
Well, every time I get to look at the messages I write here again, it feels so cringe that I want to rewrite it from scratch. </br>
So, I am a software engineering enthusiast mostly interested in spheres of web applications and system software. <br/>
My favourite programming languages are Go, C, and TypeScript. Looking forward to add Nim in this sequence. <br/>
Favourite techs aint all the techs you use, I also work with Lua and C++. <br/>
That's all I have to say yet.
