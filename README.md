<h3> Hey there, I am Intervinn </h3>
I am just an average teen, suffering from anxiety and being afraid of future. I am a fan of software engineering and computer science overall. <br/>

Whenever I get burned out (happens quite often lately), I just play a lot of games as computer is usually the only thing to entertain me. </br>
  
Whenever I begin to write this, each sentence gets to begin with "I". I write and speak the way I think, usually not thinking about grammatical rules.

###### this is quite fun to see the sentences starting with the same word
  
I guess I am a Web Developer, but I barely developed anything web related in last 6 months, mostly low level stuff. </br>

I really can't be bothered to say that I am fluent in one or other language, its just a first step in making a program, but I had quite a long time experience of using languages such as Go, TypeScript, C, C++, Lua. For technologies, my favourite stack is React(Nuxt)/Vue(Nuxt) x Tailwind and Express/Fiber x TypeORM/GORM x Postgres.  </br>

I am looking towards learning Java, which seems quite good as C++ with more syntax sugar and less pain, and Rust, which seems getting quite more popular and has some unique syntax. </br>

Even though I'd like to stick with good old readable C-styled syntax, I get quite attracted to so called "exotic" languages - MoonScript, Crystal, Nim, and V. I've seen Nature language, seems quite promising. <br/>
I feel like I have been quite knocked out, I became less productive and began to forget some stuff. I wish this ends soon.
