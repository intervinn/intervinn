<h3> Hey there, I am Intervinn </h3>
Highly interested in web development and computer science. I also love making circuits and building PCs. </br>
I dream to become a professional web developer and a software engineer. One day, one day... I am just 15, so everything is still ahead. <br/>
Out of programming languages, I like to search and sometimes write some "exotic" languages such as Crystal, MoonScript, Nim, V and Dart. But primarily prefering Go and TypeScript. </br>
Do not use Rust, C/C++ already got everything you need, and if you are having issues such as memory leaks - that is your problem.
